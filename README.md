# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions to 2020's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about).

The solutions are provided in Python, Lua, and as homebrew Nintendo 3DS programs (C++).

Each day has it's own `README.md` file with the corresponding puzzle's description, automatically transformed into markdown, to ease the remembering and understanding of the solutions. Obviously, the creator of these puzzles and descriptions is [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).

Each program responsible for solving a puzzle also checks that the output generated is my own correct solution to that puzzle (which is hardcoded into the source code after solving the puzzle). This is done with an `assert` in the last (or second to last, if there's an `exit()`) line executed in the program. The programs also have some commented-out debug lines, or other explanations, to give some insight about how their development process went.

There were no specific objectives set for the solutions' code in terms of time, memory or code quality optimizations. My only goal was to code the solutions in languages I wanted to get more used to (Lua and 3DS C++).

I may or may not drop midway through the event. Puzzles completion is not guaranteed.
